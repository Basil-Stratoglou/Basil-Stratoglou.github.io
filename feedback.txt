 Some specific feedback on the case:

    The end result is simple but quite elegant and it’s nice to see that there is an animation and multiple themes
    We like the design you went for
    The GitHub username field is validated and gives a nice error message if it doesn’t exist

Improvement potential:

    We’re missing a backend, to see fullstack capabilities
    No frontend framework seems to have been used for the case
    We’re wondering how you would approach building a scalable application
    All JS code is in two files using plain JS - while it does it job end-result wise, we would have liked to see a bit more - 
    e.g. to be able to see how the app could be extended and maintained
