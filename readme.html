      <p>This is the full stack developer teck case for Karma</p>
      <p>
        I have used Bootstrap 4 at the frontend, since all its components are
        mobile friendly, while some are also have Accessible Rich Internet
        Applications (ARIA) attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the calls are being made to the Github API, fetching back some basic
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have used validation on all possible fields, but I have not
        implemented more test. Automated coding tests is something I have only a
        few experience with and I would like to delve more into. I believe you
        can offer me this experience.
      </p>

        Start by entering your github username, which the form validates and
        allows you to continue to the next page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The slider provides the switch between light and dark theme, while you
        can select from a multitude of other themes by clicking the
        corresponding link on the navigation bar.
